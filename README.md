# Forest-Cover-Classification-with-Deep-Learning
This project aims to predict forest cover types based on cartographic variables using Tensorflow and deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project includes information from the US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data, which provides the actual forest cover type for 30 x 30 meter cells.
