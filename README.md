# Forest Cover Classification with Deep Learning

This project aims to predict forest cover types based on cartographic variables using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project includes information from the US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data, which provides the actual forest cover type for 30 x 30 meter cells. The goal is to develop accurate classifiers using TensorFlow with Keras and optimize their performance through hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset
The dataset contains raw, unscaled data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. It includes binary columns for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type. The forest cover types to be predicted are as follows:
- Spruce/Fir
- Lodgepole Pine
- Ponderosa Pine
- Cottonwood/Willow
- Aspen
- Douglas-fir
- Krummholz

## Project Objectives
- Develop one or more classifiers for multi-class classification of forest cover types.
- Utilize TensorFlow with Keras to build and train the classifiers.
- Apply hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the model performance.
- Test and analyze the performance of the classifiers, evaluating their accuracy and effectiveness.
- Maintain clean and modular code for better collaboration and maintainability.
